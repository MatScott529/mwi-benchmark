### Communication

- You are needing more page content for a marketing site project, the project manager is out of town and you need to contact the client to get the page done by the deadline. You need both photos and a couple of paragraphs for the “About Us” page.

- Hello < Client Contact >

  My name is Matthew Scott and I am the Frontend Developer working on your marketing site. I am contacting you while the Project Manager is out of town to ensure the "About Us" page is completed on time. Currently, in order to complete this page on time I need a couple more pieces of content.

  The first are the images needed for this page. Please ensure these a not high resolution images as this could effect pape load times. If have any questions about this please let me know.

  Lastly, I need two paragraphs of copy for the "About Us" page. This content will sit below the banner image and needs to be a consice summary of what your company is all 'about'.

  It would be best if you could get me this content before end of day tommorw in order for us to meet the deadline. Again, if you have any clarifying questions please feel free to reach out.

  Hope you have a great rest of your day,  
  < Company Branded Signature >

### Code Test

- Regarding the puzzle section, the README.md used the word object but I used an array of strings as this seemed to make sense for the data give. I can redo this with JS objects if need be.
- I did not explicitaly add classes to all elements as it seemed like over kill with module class wrappers.
